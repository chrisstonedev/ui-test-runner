# UI Test Runner

This project was first created as part of the **[chrisstonedev/technical-debt](https://github.com/chrisstonedev/technical-debt)** project that accompanies my first public talk, ["Buried in Technical Debt? Making the Right Investments in Your Code"](https://chrisstone.dev/speaking/technical-debt). The context is that I needed a way to test my sample application while I refactored it to make sure that the refactoring was safe.

I had spent some time trying to find a solution that I could safely use for demonstration periods in my talk that would be both reliable and free to use (both _libre_ and _gratis_). In the end, I took on the challenge of creating my own testing application that could be used. At first, the intention was to be used against a Visual Basic 6.0 application. Over time, I also wanted to use it against a .NET WPF application.

I enjoyed creating this application, and after I had given my talk, I saw value in continuing to build this application to be for a more generic use. For this reason, I decided to copy the repository and build the UI Test Runner project into something more robust and leave only the actual code behind the technical debt talk in its repository.

## How to use

Currently, this project requires the use of the **chrisstonedev/technical-debt** projects as it is tightly integrated into the functionality of those specific programs.

Future development will allow for more generic uses for many kinds of applications.
